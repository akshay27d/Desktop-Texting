# Desktop-Texting
A way to send and receive SMS from a desktop computer

This project was inspired by the inability to to text through an android phone on a macbook.

As of June 24, due to accidently committing some personal details and realizing later on, I had to delete approximately 15 commits, then recommit a newer version.

On the computer, the program is run through terminal for the Python 2 version and a GUI in the Python 3 version.
